The main motivation behind this arduino library is to familiarise new students to the concepts of line follower robot. I plan to integrate various operation modes. Intended user of this library are students who are building line follwer robots from scratch.

User should be able to download this as a zip file and immediately start using it.

I'm taking help from http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Library
